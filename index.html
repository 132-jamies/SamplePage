      <p>I go to Riverside Secondary School. I  had to transfer here because my old school's high school had to close due to finanacial issues.</p>
      <p>The assignments at Riverside are very different from my old school. Just take a look at the video I had to shoot for a french assignment. I would've never done something like this at my old school</p>
    <p>Actors: Joel and Mark</p>

    </h3>
      <p>I play AA baseball so it's not that good but I still love the sport!</p>
      <p>My top 2 positions are backcatcher and second base, in that order! I also Umpire as a job and I make a killing with not doing a lot of actual work!</p>

      <p>You might be asking, "Well what do you do when you aren't playing baseball or going to school?"</p>
      <p>If I'm not doing homework or excerciseing I might be watching TV, playing videogames on my computer, holding my hamster, or playing with my little brother.</p>
